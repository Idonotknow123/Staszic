## ⚠️ Important Information

* **Selection:** The tasks presented here represent a **curated, more interesting subset** of all problems solved on the [SIO2](https://sio2.staszic.waw.pl/) portal during my 4 years of Computer Science in high school.
* **Optimization:** These solutions may be informal in nature. Some might not be 100% optimal in terms of time or space complexity – they focus on readability and passing the required test cases, as they were designed to prepare for work within the [OIOIOI](https://sio2.mimuw.edu.pl/) environment.
* **Execution:** At least the `C++17` standard is recommended for compilation. In most cases, only the `main.cpp` file is provided.

## 🤝 Acknowledgments
I would like to express my gratitude to my colleagues, without whom preparing these solutions would have been significantly more difficult:

* **Franciszek Gepner**
* **Jan Gwiazda**
* **Michał Szeliga**
* **Kajetan Ramsza**
